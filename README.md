# BackboneJs 1-on-1

### What is Backbone?

>Backbone, contrary to what many might believe is a lightweight JavaScript library, and not a framework,
>that adds structure to your client-side code.

### What is it used for?

>Develpers usually use libraries like Backbone to to create *single-page applications*(SPA's).

### What is a MVC?

>MVC stand for "Model View Controller".
>A number of moder JavaScript frameworks provide developers an easy path to organising their code using
>variations of a pattern known as MVC.

**MVC seperates the concerns in an application into thee parts:**
- Models represent the domain-specific knowledge and data in an application. Think of this a being a type
of data you can model.
- Views typically constitute the user interface in an application (such as markup and templates). **They observe models.**
- Controller handles the input and update models.

### Why consider using BackboneJs?

>Backbone provides a minimal set of data-structuring (models, collections) and user
> interface (views, URLs) primitives that are helpful when your'e building dynamic applications using
>Javascript.

>It's not opinionated, meaning you have the freedom to and flexibility
>to build the best experience for your web application however you see fit.

>It doesn't prescribe any specific template engine; while you are free to use
>the microtemplating offered by Underscore.js (one of its dependencies), views
>can bind to HTML constructed via your templating solution of choice.
